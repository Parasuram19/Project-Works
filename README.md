# Face Depth Estimation Program

This is a Python-based Face Depth Estimation Program that utilizes the `facemeshmodule`, `cvzone`, and `numpy` modules to estimate the depth of a face from a 2D image or a live video feed.

## Introduction

The Face Depth Estimation Program is designed to estimate the depth of a person's face using the popular `facemeshmodule`, a computer vision library, along with `cvzone` for visualization and `numpy` for numerical computations. The program processes images or video frames and provides an approximate depth map of the detected face.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `facemeshmodule`
- `cvzone`
- `numpy`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install facemeshmodule
pip install cvzone
pip install numpy
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the `face_depth_estimation.py` script, either with a single image or a live video feed.

### Running with an Image

To estimate the depth from an image, use the following command:

```bash
python face_depth_estimation.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```

The program will process the image, detect faces, and generate a depth map.

### Running with a Live Video Feed

To estimate the depth from a live video feed, use the following command:

```bash
python face_depth_estimation.py --video
```

The program will open your default camera and process each frame, providing a real-time depth estimation.

## Output

The program generates a depth map for the detected face, where different shades of color represent different depths from the camera. The output will be displayed on the screen for both the image and video feed modes.
